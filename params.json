It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"### Welcome to Xenapi Admin Tools.\r\nThe xe command is great for scripting but not quite as nice in interactive mode. Xenapi Admin Tools are commandline tools to help Xen Cloud Platform/Xenserver administrators manage their clouds from the comandline. Sometimes the tool just presents data in a quick, concise manner and other times it provides wizards to edit/create cloud objects such as Virtual Machines, Storage Repositories, Networks etc.. \r\n\r\nXenapi Admin Tools also includes an API and library that helps create tools quickly and efficiently. A lot of functions to gather information from the cloud, sort data and display it has already been written. \r\n\r\nTo get the tools via git:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/Xenapi-Admin-Project/xenapi-admin-tools\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nXenapi Admin Tools are managed by the Xenapi Admin Project. Current team members are Grant McWilliams @grantmcwilliams, Lisa Nguyen @lisatn, Matthew Spah @mattsface, Michael Webber @mrwebberone and Paul Maack @PaulTMaack.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
